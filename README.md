Exploring the State of the Visual Field in the Age of Extreme Augmentation

## Thematic Statement
Human perception has long been influenced by technological breakthroughs. An intimate mediation of technology lies in between our direct perceptions. Through three extreme ideal types of perceptual machines, this project defamiliarizes and questions the habitual ways in which we interpret, operate, and understand the visual world intervened by digital media.   

Hyperallergenic Vision 

We have observed an increase in allergies and intolerances in modern society. Hypersensitivities are emerging not only medically but also mentally. Digital media reinforce people’s tendency to overreact through the viral spread of information and amplification of opinions, making us hypersensitive to our sociopolitical environment. By creating an artificial allergy to the color red, this machine manifests the nonsensical hypersensitivity created by digital media. In nocebo mode, red expands, which is similar to social media’s amplification effect; in placebo mode, red shrinks, like our filtered communication landscape where we can unfollow people with different opinions.

Tactile Vision 

Obsessively searching online for one thing is like looking through a pinhole where we build up everything without an overview. This machine helps to make the wearer conscious of how we navigate the internet naturally narrows our views of the world. The silicon mask breathes gently when the light is far away, while rapidly when the light gets closer. The wearer can navigate in space and find each other in total darkness with this tactile vision, like a dating App for cave animals. Similar to searching, when you are only looking for one thing, you lose the capacity to see things in context to make more informed decisions.

Commoditized Vision 

Our visual field is packed with so much information that our perception has become a commodity with real estate value. By creating tension between the meditative state and the consumptive state, this machine contemplates how our perception has become part of the value chain in this particular socioeconomic context. You can earn money by looking at advertisements, and spend money to see an ads free world.

## Implementation
TransVision is an AR mobile application where we implemented Hyperallergenic Vision for expanding red zone.
